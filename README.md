# ASOUL Resurrected
Discord bot written in TS with discord.js.
## About bot
### Name
In 2019, I created the ASOUL my first discord bot. But due to the fact that I did not develop bots for some period, so in 2022 it finally stopped working. But due to the fact that the code was terrible, I decided that it would be more correct to write the bot again, but keeping its name, thereby ressurecting it. The old version is still available [here](https://github.com/ClintFlames/ASOUL) if you want to check it for some reason.
### Functional
ASOUL has always been a tool bot. What does it mean? ASOUL has no database, hence no settings. But it can do some useful things, such as generating a short link or a qr-code.
### Commands
uptime - Displays uptime<br>
flip - Heads or tails<br>
qrcode - Generates QR code from text or link<br>
shortlink - Shortens the link<br>
weather - Returns weather in specified city<br>
